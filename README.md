### Where can I get this and how?
Currently this panel is still in development. For panel updats, join the [Support Discord](http://discord.aidanoh.art "Support Discord") for updates. The panel will cost Â£29.50 (Around $39) and will include life time support and I will give all advice I can to help fix any problems or make anything compatible for you!
